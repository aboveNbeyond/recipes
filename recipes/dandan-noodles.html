     <h3>Extra Tips</h3>
     <h4>Mixing the sauce</h4>
     <p>If this is your first time cooking with Chinese sesame paste, you will usually find it is separated into oil on top and thick paste underneath. To make it easy to use, stir the sesame paste thoroughly in the jar to incorporate the oil with the paste. Without this step, you will find the sesame paste very thin on the top of your jar and very dry on the bottom.</p>
     <p>Sesame paste has a tendency to thicken when you stir in the liquid. The best way to mix the sauce is to add the sesame paste first, then mix in the liquid ingredients little by little. Whisk the mixture with a pair of chopsticks (or a spoon) until the solid paste is fully blended with the liquid. Then add more liquid and repeat, so everything will dissolve evenly.</p>

     <h4>Frying the Pork</h4>
     <p>To properly prepare the pork for dan dan Noodles, you’ll need to “overcook” the pork.Use medium-high heat to cook brown surface first, then turn to medium heat to let it roast until the liquid in the meat is fully released and evaporated. In the end you will have dark-brown colored pork without adding any soy sauce. The pork bits will be a bit chewy and have an almost-crispy texture when hot.</p>
    <h4>Assembling the Dan Dan noodles</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pour some sauce in a small bowl and chili oil according to your taste</li>
        <li>Add the noodles</li>
        <li>Top with minced pork, green veggies, crushed peanuts, and green onions</li>
        <li>Mix and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
